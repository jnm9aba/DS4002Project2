One of my fav people on the planet - our YOUNG ROCK creator and director â€” Nahnatchka  Khan. 

Sheâ€™s a gifted and hungry storyteller who will always deliver QUALITY, LAUGHS & HEART. 

Hereâ€™s some crazy facts - her brother, is my good buddy Nick Kahn - who is the the co-CEO of WWE. 
Me, Nanatchka and Nick were running around the same pro wrestling shows when we were kids back in the 80s when we all lived in Hawaii together. 

Years laterâ€¦.. here we are all together again in this capacity. 

I think season 3 of YOUNG ROCK may very well be our best season yet. 

And I have this woman, Nahnatchka to thank for that.
