GREAT training session here in Mexico City 🇲🇽💪🏾💪🏾

High altitude (approx 7,400 ft) pushed my lung capacity - which is a good thing and kicked my body into another state. 

Muchos Gracias mi amigos @sportsworldmex for all the love, being so kind and giving me my space to train. 

Now the work begins… 

Can’t wait!!
