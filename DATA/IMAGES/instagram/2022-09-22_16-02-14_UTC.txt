“I began dancing before I was born, in my mother’s womb. When she would enter the Powwow Circle, she would bring me in with her in her belly, so that I may feel the beating of the drum, and later still remember the songs of my people when all that filled my ears was the beating of my mother’s heart.” —(@sherente) Sherenté Mishitashin Harris⁣⁣

Sherenté is Niantic Narragansett, a citizen of the Narragansett Indian Tribe. Their parents are both champion dancers. “I am an LGBTQ and Two Spirit activist who began radical change in my Powwow circuit by dancing in the style of the opposite gender. I followed in the styles of my parents — beginning with the Eastern War Dance, the style of my father, and after coming out, adopting the Fancy Shawl Dance, the style of my mother. Despite being discriminated against and excluded, I went out and danced anyways. ⁣⁣⁣
 ⁣⁣⁣
Above all, my mother stressed the importance of maintaining grace. A great Fancy Shawl dancer is graceful. Something sheer strength can never bring is the skill of poise and grace.” ⁣⁣⁣
