18-year-old visual artist @dianasinclair (Diana Sinclair) is a rising star in the NFT world. “I see my work as a celebration of identity, often that being Blackness. Growing up, I didn’t see many visuals that I felt represented in, and I wanted to create art and imagery that represented people who look like me.”
 
Diana works to educate and introduce Black people to NFTs, and crypto in general. Last June, as a bigger manifestation of that goal, she curated “The Digital Diaspora,” one of the first events of its kind. “When I started in the NFT community over a year ago, it was clear that Black art or anything representing visible Blackness was not nearly as valued as the art that didn’t. The project created safe space for Black artists in Web3 where there was none. Besides being amongst the first examples of curation in the space, or a pioneer for the NFT party format, it was monumental because it was the first exhibition highlighting Black artists in Web3.” The show returns this Juneteenth in collaboration with photographer @driftershoots (Isaac “Drift” Wright). Diana plans to make it an annual event.
 
“NFTs have helped display what a democratized art market could be like. The ethos of the space has typically been to support the creator and the community, so I’ve seen so much more artist advocacy than I have in other industries. I view myself as a visual artist that mints NFTs, because NFTs themselves are another form of sharing and selling my work. But I don’t set out to ‘make an NFT.’ I set out to make art.”
