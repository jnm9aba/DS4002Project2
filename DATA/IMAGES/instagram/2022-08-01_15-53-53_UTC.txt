“I’m motivated by the idea of making someone smile on a rough day and making some bad day just a little less bad.” —@realliamsilk (Liam Silk)

Liam’s relatable comedy videos are mostly based on real-life experiences with friends and family. “The themes to my work are very uplifting and generally upbeat ideas or topics. There is a lot of ugly in the world and I want to do anything I can to make the world just a little brighter,” says Liam, who started posting his videos during his freshman year of high school. “My work seeks to challenge the notion that to be funny you must be vulgar or bring someone down. I think comedy should be exponentially positive and shouldn’t come at the cost of someone’s feelings.”
