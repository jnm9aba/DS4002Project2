“Never doubt the power of your unique voice. Your passion and authenticity resonates and reshapes reality. It’s the goal of oppressive systems to make us feel tired, and hopeless, to forget who we are. Joy, and recognizing your power, is an act of rebellion.” —Environmental and climate activist @mayasideas (Maya Penn) 
 
At age 8, Maya started her journey as an activist. Today, all her work, including her role as the founder and CEO of an eco-fashion brand and her independent animation studio Upenndo!, merges grassroots activism, global change and the power and magic of art. 
 
“I’m a solutions-based activist,” says Maya. “It’s so important for people to know what can be done because that fuels action, empowerment and hope. I grew up in an eco-conscious household, so environmental stewardship is all I’ve ever known. Also growing up in Georgia, a heart of the civil rights movement, I’ve had the honor of receiving wisdom from elders who paved the way for voices like mine to be heard. 
 
We need societal, systemic and corporate change to reach a more sustainable and equitable world. The power of community, focusing on adaptability and intergenerational collaboration, is what will drive change.”
