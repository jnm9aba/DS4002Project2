“When I stare into their expressions and wonder why I felt the need to paint them that way, sometimes I feel that my paintings understand me better than myself.” Korean American freelance illustrator @jisuartist (Jisu) incorporates a heavy emphasis on advanced digital painting technique, as well as CG design elements in her work, bringing a fresh take to relatable themes. “A lot of my work masquerades dark themes with bright, saccharine colors. The characters you see in my work are definitely a reflection of me. They express the thoughts and feelings I have at that present time — many of which revolve around my mental health.

The most important thing to me as an individual and as an artist is being authentic. I grew up feeling very judged and boxed in due to my conservative upbringing, and in turn expressed my true self through my art. In my teens, my art went semi-viral within the fan art communities and kickstarted my career, but over time, being known for one thing pigeon-holed me into yet another box. I felt a disconnect between my work and my true self again.”

After taking a year off, Jisu felt able to express herself again. “NFTs have made it so that you as a creative no longer have to tailor yourself to the masses for their patronage, and instead can indulge in creating for only a few dedicated collectors. This shift has enabled artists like me to finally create what we want, how we want and be compensated for it.”
