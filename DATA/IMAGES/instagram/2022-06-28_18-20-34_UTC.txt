When he was a senior in high school, @feek____ (Taofeek Abijako) founded the fashion design house @headofstate_ out of his bedroom. “I’d never thought about myself being a fashion designer. As I gravitated more towards fashion, that brought back early memories.”

Those memories are from his father’s small fashion design studio in Lagos, Nigeria, where Taofeek tagged along. He was captivated by the community his father had built and his design process. “What I did was sketch the activities that were happening in the space itself. And that’s actually how I learned garment construction. I was remaking what was in front of me. I didn’t know I was training my brain as a designer.”

Six years later, the ethos of the brand that Taofeek dreamed up remains. “It’s easy to sort of move away from your original intention. I will say what I’m most proud of is the same reason I started a brand still exists today,” says Taofeek.

Instagram and the @brooklynmuseum are launching the 2022 #BlackVisionaries program to empower, center and invest in emerging Black creative communities. Last year, @headofstate_ was awarded the Visionary Small Business Grant. Learn more about the program and how to apply in today’s story.
