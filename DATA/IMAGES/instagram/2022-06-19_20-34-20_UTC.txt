“To me, freedom is and should be understood as an expansive term,” says @zysaidso (Zyahna Bryant), who is an organizer, passionate about amplifying the stories and experiences of those who are traditionally and historically excluded. This Juneteenth, she is focusing on what freedom feels and looks like to her. ⁣

“Unfortunately, rest is a luxury, but it is also a political necessity. My goal with my work and as I reflect on Juneteenth is to center rest and regeneration for those who need it the most. I’d argue that the only other thing that is perhaps better than self-care is community care. It’s the love, the energy, the accountability that we receive from being in space with those who love us, with those who have a shared goal for the future. For those who are just learning and just figuring it out, that is the beautiful part about being in community. That is the beautiful part about struggling toward collective liberation and collective and comprehensive freedom.”⁣
