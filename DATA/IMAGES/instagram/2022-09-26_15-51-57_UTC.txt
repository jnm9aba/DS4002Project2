“I always want to be honest and relatable. I want people to feel heard when they hear my music.” —Singer-songwriter @catburns (Cat Burns) 
 
“I like to write about things we experience, but don’t always talk about openly, like prioritizing mental health and how painful friendship breakups can be. I always like to do something unexpected, so the lyrics could be something serious, but it’s juxtaposed against a catchy melody.” 
 
Cat’s stripped-back pop includes her post-breakup anthem “Go,” and “Free,” a celebration of self-acceptance and the courage needed to come out to family. “Opening up about my experiences through music is part of my healing process — it’s definitely a form of therapy. I’ve found so much more happiness and understanding of myself by living my truth.”
