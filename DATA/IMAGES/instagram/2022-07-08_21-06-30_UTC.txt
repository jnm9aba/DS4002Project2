Aboriginal artist, photographer and designer @bobbilockyer (Bobbi Lockyer) creates work that refuses to be defined by conventional means. “It is influenced by the stories of the past, the colors of country and the waves of the ocean, along with my deep-rooted passion for community and dream of a better world,” says Bobbi.

“I feel a deep affinity for country and community and use my art, fashion and photography as a platform to raise awareness of social justice issues, including Indigenous rights and women’s rights,” says Bobbi, a member of @blaklens, a collective of Black photographers and videographers across Australia. This September, Bobbi’s fashion line will show at New York Fashion Week. “Born under a rainbow next to the sea, Gantharri — meaning ‘Queen Bee’ and ‘Grandmother’ in Ngarluma language — is my Aboriginal owned and designed inclusive label of love.”

#NAIDOCWeek celebrates the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples throughout Australia. A proud Ngarluma, Kariyarra, Nyulnyul and Yawuru woman, Bobbi is spending NAIDOC Week with her kids and giving back to her community.
