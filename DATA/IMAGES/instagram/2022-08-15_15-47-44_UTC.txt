“I do not believe your income or ethnicity should determine the value of your life.” Youth organizer and activist @frias_daphne (Daphne Frias) works at the intersection of gun violence prevention, disability justice, voting rights and the climate crisis. 
 
Daphne first got engaged politically after the 2018 Parkland mass shooting. “I was inspired by the survivors and the March For Our Lives movement. However, I was frustrated by the fact that communities like mine were not being highlighted in the gun violence prevention space. Communities of color face two to three times more gun violence on a daily basis, but our stories rarely make the headlines,” says Daphne, who calls herself “unapologetically Latina” and was born and raised in West Harlem, New York. 
 
Daphne served as the New York State director for March For Our Lives before creating her own nonprofit Box The Ballot, which aims to harness the power of absentee ballots. She’s seen firsthand how minority communities are disproportionally affected by climate change and is an outspoken advocate on the issues. In 2019 she participated in the Youth Climate Summit in Miami organized by Zero Hour and was an official spokesperson for the global climate strikes in New York City. 
 
Daphne has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair to ambulate. “To be treated as a full human being with independence and autonomy is a right not a privilege. Until disabled people can be seen wholly for who we are, we will not achieve equitable change. I believe social media platforms have a responsibility to not only share the fun moments of life but to push us to think bigger than ourselves. Sharing the stories of people who are often not seen allows us to change the narrative of what society deems as successful or important. If we are constantly surrounded by people who look like us or think the same way, we will never grow as people.”
