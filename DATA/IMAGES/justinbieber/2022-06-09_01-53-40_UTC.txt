happy birthday @kanyewest. Your art has moved me in ways noone elses has. Your taste and style has helped shape the artist I am today. Thank you for inspiring me to be confident in the things I want to create.. thank you for your public adoration for Jesus and what he means to you. No one will ever know how it feels to be Kanye West, the barriers you have broken as a black man in multiple industries that Iâ€™ll never understand, the struggles and the pressures of being the leader that you are, but you are a leader amongst leaders and I am honored to know you and call you a friend.
