Success tastes the sweetest when it's the product of hard work. We're thankful to have a team that walks their talk - like @a_w_hooper and Kevinhart4real.⁠
⁠
Our CEO, Andy Hooper, isn't aiming for Hart House to break into the QSR industry - we structured the company to disrupt existing norms, starting with how we take care of our employees.⁠ On top of our industry-leading base wage of $19-22, we also offer all employees a savings account, lifestyle spending account, a 401(k), and health coverage after 60 days of work - regardless of how many hours they work.⁠
⁠
By building a culture that centers employees as well as guests, we're able to set a higher standard for service at the restaurant - so when you visit Hart House, you'll taste, see, and feel the difference. #EatYourHartOut
