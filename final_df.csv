instagram,"“I always want to be honest and relatable. I want people to feel heard when they hear my music.” —Singer-songwriter @catburns (Cat Burns) 
 
“I like to write about things we experience, but don’t always talk about openly, like prioritizing mental health and how painful friendship breakups can be. I always like to do something unexpected, so the lyrics could be something serious, but it’s juxtaposed against a catchy melody.” 
 
Cat’s stripped-back pop includes her post-breakup anthem “Go,” and “Free,” a celebration of self-acceptance and the courage needed to come out to family. “Opening up about my experiences through music is part of my healing process — it’s definitely a form of therapy. I’ve found so much more happiness and understanding of myself by living my truth.”

instagram,"“I began dancing before I was born, in my mother’s womb. When she would enter the Powwow Circle, she would bring me in with her in her belly, so that I may feel the beating of the drum, and later still remember the songs of my people when all that filled my ears was the beating of my mother’s heart.” —(@sherente) Sherenté Mishitashin Harris⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Sherenté is Niantic Narragansett, a citizen of the Narragansett Indian Tribe. Their parents are both champion dancers. “I am an LGBTQ and Two Spirit activist who began radical change in my Powwow circuit by dancing in the style of the opposite gender. I followed in the styles of my parents — beginning with the Eastern War Dance, the style of my father, and after coming out, adopting the Fancy Shawl Dance, the style of my mother. Despite being discriminated against and excluded, I went out and danced anyways. ⁣⁣⁣
 ⁣⁣⁣
Above all, my mother stressed the importance of maintaining grace. A great Fancy Shawl dancer is graceful. Something sheer strength can never bring is the skill of poise and grace.” ⁣⁣⁣

instagram,"“Never doubt the power of your unique voice. Your passion and authenticity resonates and reshapes reality. It’s the goal of oppressive systems to make us feel tired, and hopeless, to forget who we are. Joy, and recognizing your power, is an act of rebellion.” —Environmental and climate activist @mayasideas (Maya Penn) 
 
At age 8, Maya started her journey as an activist. Today, all her work, including her role as the founder and CEO of an eco-fashion brand and her independent animation studio Upenndo!, merges grassroots activism, global change and the power and magic of art. 
 
“I’m a solutions-based activist,” says Maya. “It’s so important for people to know what can be done because that fuels action, empowerment and hope. I grew up in an eco-conscious household, so environmental stewardship is all I’ve ever known. Also growing up in Georgia, a heart of the civil rights movement, I’ve had the honor of receiving wisdom from elders who paved the way for voices like mine to be heard. 
 
We need societal, systemic and corporate change to reach a more sustainable and equitable world. The power of community, focusing on adaptability and intergenerational collaboration, is what will drive change.”

instagram,"“I do not believe your income or ethnicity should determine the value of your life.” Youth organizer and activist @frias_daphne (Daphne Frias) works at the intersection of gun violence prevention, disability justice, voting rights and the climate crisis. 
 
Daphne first got engaged politically after the 2018 Parkland mass shooting. “I was inspired by the survivors and the March For Our Lives movement. However, I was frustrated by the fact that communities like mine were not being highlighted in the gun violence prevention space. Communities of color face two to three times more gun violence on a daily basis, but our stories rarely make the headlines,” says Daphne, who calls herself “unapologetically Latina” and was born and raised in West Harlem, New York. 
 
Daphne served as the New York State director for March For Our Lives before creating her own nonprofit Box The Ballot, which aims to harness the power of absentee ballots. She’s seen firsthand how minority communities are disproportionally affected by climate change and is an outspoken advocate on the issues. In 2019 she participated in the Youth Climate Summit in Miami organized by Zero Hour and was an official spokesperson for the global climate strikes in New York City. 
 
Daphne has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair to ambulate. “To be treated as a full human being with independence and autonomy is a right not a privilege. Until disabled people can be seen wholly for who we are, we will not achieve equitable change. I believe social media platforms have a responsibility to not only share the fun moments of life but to push us to think bigger than ourselves. Sharing the stories of people who are often not seen allows us to change the narrative of what society deems as successful or important. If we are constantly surrounded by people who look like us or think the same way, we will never grow as people.”

instagram,"“When I stare into their expressions and wonder why I felt the need to paint them that way, sometimes I feel that my paintings understand me better than myself.” Korean American freelance illustrator @jisuartist (Jisu) incorporates a heavy emphasis on advanced digital painting technique, as well as CG design elements in her work, bringing a fresh take to relatable themes. “A lot of my work masquerades dark themes with bright, saccharine colors. The characters you see in my work are definitely a reflection of me. They express the thoughts and feelings I have at that present time — many of which revolve around my mental health.

The most important thing to me as an individual and as an artist is being authentic. I grew up feeling very judged and boxed in due to my conservative upbringing, and in turn expressed my true self through my art. In my teens, my art went semi-viral within the fan art communities and kickstarted my career, but over time, being known for one thing pigeon-holed me into yet another box. I felt a disconnect between my work and my true self again.”

After taking a year off, Jisu felt able to express herself again. “NFTs have made it so that you as a creative no longer have to tailor yourself to the masses for their patronage, and instead can indulge in creating for only a few dedicated collectors. This shift has enabled artists like me to finally create what we want, how we want and be compensated for it.”

instagram,"“I’m motivated by the idea of making someone smile on a rough day and making some bad day just a little less bad.” —@realliamsilk (Liam Silk)

Liam’s relatable comedy videos are mostly based on real-life experiences with friends and family. “The themes to my work are very uplifting and generally upbeat ideas or topics. There is a lot of ugly in the world and I want to do anything I can to make the world just a little brighter,” says Liam, who started posting his videos during his freshman year of high school. “My work seeks to challenge the notion that to be funny you must be vulgar or bring someone down. I think comedy should be exponentially positive and shouldn’t come at the cost of someone’s feelings.”

instagram,"Aboriginal artist, photographer and designer @bobbilockyer (Bobbi Lockyer) creates work that refuses to be defined by conventional means. “It is influenced by the stories of the past, the colors of country and the waves of the ocean, along with my deep-rooted passion for community and dream of a better world,” says Bobbi.

“I feel a deep affinity for country and community and use my art, fashion and photography as a platform to raise awareness of social justice issues, including Indigenous rights and women’s rights,” says Bobbi, a member of @blaklens, a collective of Black photographers and videographers across Australia. This September, Bobbi’s fashion line will show at New York Fashion Week. “Born under a rainbow next to the sea, Gantharri — meaning ‘Queen Bee’ and ‘Grandmother’ in Ngarluma language — is my Aboriginal owned and designed inclusive label of love.”

#NAIDOCWeek celebrates the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples throughout Australia. A proud Ngarluma, Kariyarra, Nyulnyul and Yawuru woman, Bobbi is spending NAIDOC Week with her kids and giving back to her community.

instagram,"When he was a senior in high school, @feek____ (Taofeek Abijako) founded the fashion design house @headofstate_ out of his bedroom. “I’d never thought about myself being a fashion designer. As I gravitated more towards fashion, that brought back early memories.”

Those memories are from his father’s small fashion design studio in Lagos, Nigeria, where Taofeek tagged along. He was captivated by the community his father had built and his design process. “What I did was sketch the activities that were happening in the space itself. And that’s actually how I learned garment construction. I was remaking what was in front of me. I didn’t know I was training my brain as a designer.”

Six years later, the ethos of the brand that Taofeek dreamed up remains. “It’s easy to sort of move away from your original intention. I will say what I’m most proud of is the same reason I started a brand still exists today,” says Taofeek.

Instagram and the @brooklynmuseum are launching the 2022 #BlackVisionaries program to empower, center and invest in emerging Black creative communities. Last year, @headofstate_ was awarded the Visionary Small Business Grant. Learn more about the program and how to apply in today’s story.

instagram,"“To me, freedom is and should be understood as an expansive term,” says @zysaidso (Zyahna Bryant), who is an organizer, passionate about amplifying the stories and experiences of those who are traditionally and historically excluded. This Juneteenth, she is focusing on what freedom feels and looks like to her. ⁣
⁣
“Unfortunately, rest is a luxury, but it is also a political necessity. My goal with my work and as I reflect on Juneteenth is to center rest and regeneration for those who need it the most. I’d argue that the only other thing that is perhaps better than self-care is community care. It’s the love, the energy, the accountability that we receive from being in space with those who love us, with those who have a shared goal for the future. For those who are just learning and just figuring it out, that is the beautiful part about being in community. That is the beautiful part about struggling toward collective liberation and collective and comprehensive freedom.”⁣

instagram,"18-year-old visual artist @dianasinclair (Diana Sinclair) is a rising star in the NFT world. “I see my work as a celebration of identity, often that being Blackness. Growing up, I didn’t see many visuals that I felt represented in, and I wanted to create art and imagery that represented people who look like me.”
 
Diana works to educate and introduce Black people to NFTs, and crypto in general. Last June, as a bigger manifestation of that goal, she curated “The Digital Diaspora,” one of the first events of its kind. “When I started in the NFT community over a year ago, it was clear that Black art or anything representing visible Blackness was not nearly as valued as the art that didn’t. The project created safe space for Black artists in Web3 where there was none. Besides being amongst the first examples of curation in the space, or a pioneer for the NFT party format, it was monumental because it was the first exhibition highlighting Black artists in Web3.” The show returns this Juneteenth in collaboration with photographer @driftershoots (Isaac “Drift” Wright). Diana plans to make it an annual event.
 
“NFTs have helped display what a democratized art market could be like. The ethos of the space has typically been to support the creator and the community, so I’ve seen so much more artist advocacy than I have in other industries. I view myself as a visual artist that mints NFTs, because NFTs themselves are another form of sharing and selling my work. But I don’t set out to ‘make an NFT.’ I set out to make art.”

My intention was to create a safe place, a place without judgment. A place to be free of perfectionism and overthinking. A place to scream, release, feel freedom. It was a beautiful journey of exploration. I hope you find joy in this music. I hope it inspires you to release the wiggle. Ha! And to feel as unique, strong, and sexy as you are.",6/30/2022 16:02,4624056

Researchers have found that the close bonds these orphans forge with one another help defray the stress of being separated from their mothers and herds. Young orphaned elephants living with peers or other family members, such as aunts, cousins, or siblings, had stress hormone levels comparable to young elephants living with their mothers.

And yet the wilderness that stands to be explored and ruled over by these top predators shrinks with every passing year. Africa’s lions have been eradicated from 90% of their historic range due to poaching, habitat loss, and conflict with humans. In the pockets of sub-Saharan Africa where they still maintain strongholds, their future is increasingly uncertain. Protecting and expanding space for lions to roam safely has been at the heart of my conservation work for decades. It’s simply impossible to imagine an Africa without them.
